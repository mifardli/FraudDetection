#Fraud Detection Project

##Overview
This project aims to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques, specifically employing the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset contains information related to transactions and is used to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

##Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data . 

###Data Description
- **Columns:** The dataset comprises several columns/features that include transaction details such as transaction amount, time, type, and other relevant information.
- **Size:** The dataset consists of [mention the number of rows and columns].

##Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project begins with an Exploratory Data Analysis phase to gain insights into the dataset. Key steps in the EDA process include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues if any.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Basic statistical summaries and descriptive statistics for numerical features.
- **Visualization:** Creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

##Visualization
Various visualizations are created to explore different aspects of the dataset:
- **Histograms:** Displaying distributions of numeric variables.
- **Box plots:** Identifying outliers and understanding feature distributions.
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Analyzing correlations between features to identify potentially significant relationships.

##Model Creation - Random Forests Algorithm
The project involves building a fraud detection model using the Random Forest algorithm:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Features are preprocessed and prepared for model training.
- **Model Training:** The Random Forest classifier is trained using the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model parameters to improve performance.
- **Validation and Testing:** Validating the model on unseen data and testing its generalizability.

##Conclusion
The README provides an overview of the fraud detection project, including EDA, visualization, and the creation of a Random Forest model. Further enhancements and fine-tuning of the model can be explored to improve its accuracy and robustness.
