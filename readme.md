# Fraud Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques, specifically employing the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset contains transactional information and is utilized to predict fraudulent transactions.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data .

### Data Description
- **Columns:** The dataset comprises several columns/features, including transaction amount, time, type, and other relevant information.
- **Size:** The dataset consists of [mention the number of rows and columns].

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project commences with an Exploratory Data Analysis phase to gain insights into the dataset. Key steps in the EDA process include:
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues if any.
- **Statistical Summaries:** Basic statistical summaries and descriptive statistics for numerical features.
- **Visualization:** Creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.

## Visualization
Various visualizations are generated to explore different aspects of the dataset:
- **Histograms:** Displaying distributions of numeric variables.
- **Box plots:** Identifying outliers and understanding feature distributions.
- **Correlation Heatmaps:** Analyzing correlations between features to identify potentially significant relationships.

## Model Creation - Random Forests Algorithm
The project involves building a fraud detection model using the Random Forest algorithm:
- **Data Preprocessing:** Features are preprocessed and prepared for model training.
- **Model Training:** The Random Forest classifier is trained using the preprocessed data.
- **Model Evaluation:** Assessing the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tuning the model parameters to improve performance.
- **Validation and Testing:** Validating the model on unseen data and testing its generalizability.

## How to Use
1. **Environment Setup:** Set up the required Python environment and dependencies specified in the `requirements.txt` file.
2. **Run the Notebook:** Execute the Jupyter notebook `fraud_detection.ipynb` or Python script `fraud_detection.py` to replicate the analysis and model creation process.
3. **Interpretation:** Refer to the comments and markdown cells in the notebook for detailed explanations of each step.

## Conclusion
The README provides an overview of the fraud detection project, covering EDA, visualization, and the creation of a Random Forest model. Further improvements and fine-tuning of the model can be explored to enhance its accuracy and robustness.
