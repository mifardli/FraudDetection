Fraud Detection Project
Overview
This project aims to develop a fraud detection model using machine learning techniques, specifically employing the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset contains information related to transactions and is used to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project includes from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection/data .

Data Description
Columns: The dataset comprises several columns/features that include transaction details such as transaction amount, time, type, and other relevant information.
Size: The dataset consists of [mention the number of rows and columns].
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The project begins with an Exploratory Data Analysis phase to gain insights into the dataset. Key steps in the EDA process include:

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues if any.
Statistical Summaries: Basic statistical summaries and descriptive statistics for numerical features.
Visualization: Creating visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and correlation matrices to understand the data distribution and relationships between features.
Visualization
Various visualizations are created to explore different aspects of the dataset:

Histograms: Displaying distributions of numeric variables.
Box plots: Identifying outliers and understanding feature distributions.
Correlation Heatmaps: Analyzing correlations between features to identify potentially significant relationships.
Model Creation - Random Forests Algorithm
The project involves building a fraud detection model using the Random Forest algorithm:

Data Preprocessing: Features are preprocessed and prepared for model training.
Model Training: The Random Forest classifier is trained using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model parameters to improve performance.
Validation and Testing: Validating the model on unseen data and testing its generalizability.
